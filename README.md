Sudoku Solver
A simple Sudoku Solver built using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface. This application allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle, and the program solves it using a backtracking algorithm.

Features
Interactive 9x9 grid for Sudoku input
Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking
Option to clear the grid or input new puzzles
Visualizes the solving process in real-time
Input validation to prevent incorrect puzzle entries
Technologies Used
Java: For core logic and backtracking algorithm
Java Swing: For building the user interface
How It Works
The Sudoku Solver uses a backtracking algorithm that works as follows:

Find the first empty cell in the grid.
Try placing numbers 1 through 9 in the empty cell.
Check if placing the number violates Sudoku rules (i.e., no duplicates in rows, columns, or 3x3 grids).
Recursively attempt to solve the rest of the puzzle.
If no valid number can be placed, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next possible number.
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity
The time complexity of the backtracking algorithm used in the Sudoku solver is quite high due to the large number of possible combinations the algorithm must explore.

In the worst case, the algorithm tries to fill each of the 81 cells (for a 9x9 Sudoku grid) with numbers between 1 and 9.
For each empty cell, the algorithm may potentially try all 9 possible numbers, leading to a time complexity of approximately O(9^(n)), where n is the number of empty cells.
For a completely blank Sudoku grid (all 81 cells empty), the time complexity becomes O(9^81), which is exponential. However, most real-world Sudoku puzzles have many pre-filled cells, reducing the number of recursive calls.

Space Complexity
The space complexity depends on the number of recursive calls made by the backtracking algorithm, which is proportional to the number of empty cells in the grid.

In the worst case, the recursion stack can grow up to a depth of n, where n is the number of empty cells.
Therefore, the space complexity is O(n) due to the depth of the recursion.
Additionally, the space used to store the board (9x9 grid) is O(1) since the size of the grid is constant
